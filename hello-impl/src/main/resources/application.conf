  # executions of the query on a best effort basis. The query is using a Cassandra Materialized
  # View for the query and that is eventually consistent, so different queries may see different
  # events for the latest events, but eventually the result will be ordered by timestamp
  # (Cassandra timeuuid column). To compensate for the the eventual consistency the query is
  # delayed to not read the latest events, the duration of this delay is defined by this
  # configuration property.
  # However, this is only best effort and in case of network partitions
  # or other things that may delay the updates of the Materialized View the events may be
  # delivered in different order (not strictly by their timestamp).
